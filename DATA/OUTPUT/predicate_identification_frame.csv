Finally	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
question	_	_
regarding	_	_

The	_	_

I	_	_

for	_	_
comments	_	PRED
to	_	_
all	_	_
business	_	_
controllers	_	_
.	_	_
I	_	_
do	PRED	PRED
n't	_	_
believe	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
we	_	_
are	PRED	PRED
quite	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_
point	_	_
that	_	_
we	_	_
can	_	_
say	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
all	_	_
business	_	_
controllers	_	_

have	PRED	PRED
reviewed	PRED	PRED

understand	PRED	PRED

have	PRED	PRED
implemented	PRED	PRED
these	_	_

And	_	_
not	_	_
to	_	_
belittle	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
process	_	PRED
of	_	_
creating	_	PRED
the	_	_
standards	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
tough	_	_
part	_	_
(	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
real	_	_
meat	_	_
behind	_	_
this	_	_
)	_	_
will	_	_
be	PRED	PRED
an	_	_
effective	_	_
exception	_	_
report	_	PRED
on	_	_
a	_	_
global	_	_
basis	_	_

these	_	_

My	_	_
commitment	_	PRED

Rick	_	_

that	_	_
I	_	_
will	_	_
have	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
global	_	_

in	_	_
production	_	PRED
by	_	_
the	_	_

of	_	_
the	_	_

There	_	_

the	_	_

even	_	_

question	PRED	PRED

the	_	_
absence	_	PRED

I	_	_
guess	PRED	PRED
between	_	_

that	_	_
would	_	_
permit	PRED	PRED

a	_	_

excuse	_	PRED

it	_	_
that	_	_

our	_	_

chunk	_	_
of	_	_

primary	_	_

They	_	_
are	PRED	PRED
deemed	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
be	PRED	PRED
on	_	_
notice	_	PRED
that	_	_

had	PRED	PRED

it	_	_

if	_	_
they	_	_
wanted	PRED	PRED

a	_	_

a	_	_

the	_	_

did	PRED	PRED

Our	_	_
letter	_	_

simply	_	_
memorializes	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
we	_	_

charge	PRED	PRED

the	_	_

I	_	_
just	_	_
got	PRED	PRED
done	PRED	PRED
looking	_	PRED
at	_	_
the	_	_

contract	_	_
language	_	_

in	_	_
the	_	_
pro	_	_
forma	_	_
service	_	_
agreement	_	PRED
in	_	_
the	_	_
tariff	_	PRED
and	_	_
it	_	_
specifically	_	_
says	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
the	_	_
max	_	_
rate	_	_
would	_	_
apply	PRED	PRED
unless	_	_
a	_	_
discount	_	PRED
or	_	_
negotiated	PRED	_
rate	_	_
has	PRED	PRED
been	PRED	PRED
agreed	PRED	PRED

My	_	_
concern	_	PRED
with	_	_
adding	_	PRED
the	_	_
language	_	_
below	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
,	_	_
could	_	_
it	_	_
be	PRED	PRED
argued	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
not	_	_
everyone	_	_
knew	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
rate	_	_
would	_	_
or	_	_
could	_	_
apply	PRED	PRED
at	_	_
any	_	_
point	_	_
,	_	_
since	_	_
we	_	_
just	_	_
stated	PRED	PRED
Topack	_	_
and	_	_
Needles	_	_
and	_	_
if	_	_
they	_	_
knew	PRED	PRED
they	_	_
might	_	_
have	PRED	PRED
bid	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
different	_	_
rate	_	_
??	_	_
After	_	_
discussions	_	PRED
with	_	_
the	_	_
commercial	_	_
group	_	_
I	_	_
propose	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
that	_	_
redlined	_	_
language	_	_
be	PRED	PRED
added	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
the	_	_
attached	PRED	_
Dynegy	_	_
agreement	_	PRED
and	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
4	_	_
other	_	_
negotiated	PRED	_
rate	_	_
agreements	_	PRED
we	_	_
've	PRED	PRED
done	PRED	PRED

If	_	_

s	_	_
house	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
since	_	_
I	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
able	_	PRED
to	_	_
catch	PRED	PRED
it	_	_
very	_	_
easily	_	_
(	_	_
normally	_	_
mice	_	_
move	PRED	PRED
at	_	_
the	_	_
speed	_	_
of	_	_
light	_	_
)	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
since	_	_
it	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
acting	_	PRED
unresponsive	_	PRED
,	_	_
I	_	_
thought	PRED	PRED
it	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
infected	PRED	PRED
with	_	_
mouse	_	_
poison	_	_
,	_	_
since	_	_
my	_	_
friend	_	_
uses	PRED	PRED
it	_	_
.	_	_
I	_	_
know	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
the	_	_
mouse	_	_
will	_	_
probably	_	_
die	PRED	PRED
,	_	_
but	_	_
I	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
wondering	_	PRED
if	_	_
there	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
any	_	_
cure	_	PRED
for	_	_
mouse	_	_
poison	_	_
?	_	_
I	_	_
just	_	_
hate	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
see	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
poor	_	_
dears	_	_
experience	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
slow	_	_
painful	_	_
death	_	PRED
that	_	_
way	_	PRED
:(	_	_
.	_	_
Without	_	_
knowing	_	PRED
the	_	_
exact	_	_
poison	_	_
,	_	_
no	_	_
.	_	_
A	_	_
common	_	_
one	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
arsenic	_	_
and	_	_
there	_	_
really	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
n't	_	_
a	_	_
way	_	PRED
to	_	_
cure	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
.	_	_
Take	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
mouse	_	_
to	_	_
an	_	_
emergency	_	_
vet	_	_
and	_	_
have	PRED	PRED
them	_	_
use	PRED	PRED
CO2	_	_
to	_	_
put	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
mouse	_	_
to	_	_
sleep	_	_
.	_	_
Or	_	_
,	_	_
you	_	_
can	_	_
put	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
animal	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
snap	_	_
trap	_	_
designed	PRED	PRED
for	_	_
rats	_	_
or	_	_
mice	_	_
since	_	_
that	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
only	_	_
really	_	_
humane	_	_
kill	_	_
method	_	_
for	_	_
invasive	_	_
animals	_	_
.	_	_
A	_	_
quick	_	_
cure	_	PRED
would	_	_
be	PRED	PRED
Arm	_	_

out	_	_
,	_	_
he	_	_
wanted	PRED	PRED
attention	_	PRED
.	_	_
Secondly	_	_
,	_	_
that	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
normal	_	_
behavior	_	_
as	_	_
they	_	_
use	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
wheels	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
night	_	_
.	_	_
Thirdly	_	_
,	_	_
just	_	_
put	PRED	PRED
your	_	_
hand	_	_
in	_	_
his	_	_
cge	_	_
ans	_	_
leave	PRED	PRED
it	_	_
their	_	_
.	_	_
He	_	_
willl	_	_
eventually	_	_
come	PRED	PRED
and	_	_
explore	PRED	PRED
it	_	_
and	_	_
them	_	_
you	_	_
can	_	_
handle	PRED	PRED
him	_	_
a	_	_
little	_	_
bit	_	_

.	_	_
He	_	_
's	PRED	PRED
probably	_	_
still	_	_
scared	_	PRED
and	_	_
unsure	_	PRED
.	_	_
Once	_	_
he	_	_
has	PRED	PRED
properly	_	_
settled	PRED	PRED
down	_	_
,	_	_
got	PRED	PRED
use	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
new	_	_
smells	_	PRED
and	_	_
noises	_	_
he	_	_
will	_	_

Once	_	_
he	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
more	_	_
comfy	_	_
with	_	_
his	_	_

,	_	_
then	_	_
you	_	_
can	_	_
start	PRED	PRED
handling	_	PRED
him	_	_
and	_	_
getting	_	PRED
to	_	_
know	PRED	PRED
each	_	_
other	_	_
more	_	_

But	_	_
just	_	_
give	PRED	PRED

of	_	_
years	_	_

So	_	_
I	_	_
just	_	_
needed	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
know	PRED	PRED
if	_	_
it	_	_

that	_	_

I	_	_
heard	PRED	PRED
in	_	_
the	_	_
next	_	_
few	_	_
years	_	_
Fujairah	_	_
would	_	_
be	PRED	PRED
as	_	_

is	PRED	PRED
it	_	_
true	_	PRED

I	_	_
'd	_	_
be	PRED	PRED

going	_	PRED

be	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
great	_	_

your	_	_

T.V.	_	_

Well	_	_
,	_	_
T.V.	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
series	_	_
of	_	_
flickering	_	_
pictures	_	_
that	_	_
are	PRED	PRED
streamed	PRED	PRED
together	_	_
to	_	_
make	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
moving	_	_
picture	_	_
.	_	_
The	_	_
pictures	_	_
are	PRED	PRED
broadcast	PRED	PRED
at	_	_
a	_	_
rate	_	_
of	_	_
about	_	_
60	_	_
Hz	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
how	_	_
fast	_	_
they	_	_
need	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
move	PRED	PRED
for	_	_
us	_	_
to	_	_
see	PRED	PRED
them	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
moving	_	_
,	_	_
flawless	_	_
picture	_	_
.	_	_
To	_	_
a	_	_
dog	_	_
,	_	_
watching	_	PRED
T.V.	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
lot	_	_
like	_	_
watching	_	PRED
and	_	_
old	_	_
scratchy	_	_
silent	_	_
film	_	_
because	_	_
their	_	_
flicker	_	_
fusion	_	PRED
seems	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
occur	PRED	PRED
at	_	_
a	_	_
rate	_	_
of	_	_
70	_	_
to	_	_
80	_	_
Hz	_	_

So	_	_
they	_	_
see	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
pictures	_	_
flicker	PRED	PRED
slower	_	_
and	_	_
there	_	_
for	_	_
it	_	_
seems	PRED	PRED
choppy	_	_

them	_	_

So	_	_

are	PRED	PRED
that	_	_

your	_	_

n't	_	_
take	PRED	PRED

not	_	_

stop	PRED	PRED

I	_	_
would	_	_
do	PRED	PRED
the	_	_

idea	_	_
TBH	_	_
-	_	_
easiest	_	_

most	_	_

You	_	_
could	_	_
also	_	_
just	_	_
wait	PRED	PRED
until	_	_
the	_	_
rat	_	_
passes	PRED	PRED
out	_	_
for	_	_
about	_	_
1	_	_
minute	_	_
and	_	_
them	_	_
feed	PRED	PRED
it	_	_
-	_	_
at	_	_
this	_	_

it	_	_

be	PRED	PRED

also	_	_
maybe	_	_
try	PRED	PRED
holding	_	PRED
the	_	_
rat	_	_

to	_	_

There	_	_

very	_	_
logical	_	PRED

considered	PRED	PRED

it	_	_

n't	_	_

Dux	_	_
Litterarum	_	_
award	_	PRED

my	_	_

what	_	_
I	_	_
would	_	_
recommend	PRED	PRED

There	_	_
are	PRED	PRED

many	_	_

that	_	_

will	_	_
only	_	_
use	PRED	PRED
your	_	_

for	_	_
sleeping	_	PRED

the	_	_
extra	_	_

checked	PRED	PRED
out	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
safe	_	_
way	_	PRED
at	_	_
many	_	_
activities	_	_
so	_	_
you	_	_
can	_	_
have	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
bit	_	_
of	_	_
free	_	_
time	_	_
without	_	_
the	_	_
little	_	_

The	_	_
range	_	_
of	_	_
activities	_	_
can	_	_
be	PRED	PRED
illustrated	PRED	PRED

describing	_	PRED
the	_	_
water	_	_

a	_	_

the	_	_

the	_	_

Our	_	_
waiter	_	_
quickly	_	_
grasped	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
fact	_	_
that	_	_
I	_	_
like	PRED	PRED
Ginger	_	_
ale	_	_

rather	_	_
spicy	_	_

taste	_	PRED
ran	PRED	PRED

less	_	_
spicy	_	_
fare	_	_

Since	_	_
they	_	_
knew	PRED	PRED
our	_	_
preferences	_	PRED

we	_	_
almost	_	_
always	_	_
went	PRED	PRED
along	_	_
with	_	_
their	_	_
menu	_	_
suggestions	_	PRED
and	_	_
were	PRED	PRED
never	_	_
sorry	_	PRED
we	_	_
did	PRED	PRED

Obviously	_	_
they	_	_
had	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
full	_	_
beverage	_	_
list	_	_
including	_	PRED
alcohol	_	_
for	_	_
adults	_	_

you	_	_

it	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
consistently	_	_
good	_	PRED

I	_	_

I	_	_
gained	PRED	PRED
three	_	_

my	_	_

am	PRED	PRED

a	_	_

if	_	_
you	_	_
want	PRED	PRED
to	_	_

Well	_	_
,	_	_
almost	_	_
two	_	_
weeks	_	_

he	_	_
came	PRED	PRED
out	_	_
and	_	_
did	PRED	PRED
my	_	_

and	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
SO	_	_
flirty	_	_

He	_	_
always	_	_
hugs	PRED	PRED
me	_	_
when	_	_
he	_	_
comes	PRED	PRED

but	_	_
he	_	_
gave	PRED	PRED

at	_	_

5	_	_
tight	_	_
,	_	_
long	_	_
,	_	_
back	_	_
rubbing	_	_
hugs	_	PRED
while	_	_
he	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
there	_	_
.	_	_
We	_	_
were	PRED	PRED
also	_	_
just	_	_
talking	_	PRED
about	_	_
my	_	_
horse	_	_
's	_	_
crappy	_	_
feet	_	_
and	_	_
he	_	_
mentioned	PRED	PRED
.	_	_
|	|	_	_
Well	_	_
,	_	_
if	_	_
you	_	_
ever	_	_
just	_	_
want	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
see	PRED	PRED
me	_	_
I	_	_
'll	_	_
come	PRED	PRED
out	_	_
and	_	_
look	PRED	PRED
him	_	_
over	_	_
and	_	_
then	_	_
we	_	_
can	_	_
grab	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
coffee	_	_
after	_	_
.	_	_
|	|	_	_
That	_	_
has	PRED	PRED
NEVER	_	_
happened	PRED	PRED
before	_	_
so	_	_
I	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
kinda	_	_
realizing	_	PRED
at	_	_
that	_	_
point	_	_
that	_	_
he	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
little	_	_
interested	_	PRED
.	_	_
Anyway	_	_
,	_	_
so	_	_
he	_	_
ended	PRED	PRED
up	_	_
leaving	_	PRED
one	_	_
nail	_	_
out	_	_
of	_	_
my	_	_
horse	_	_
s	_	_
foot	_	_
(	_	_
I	_	_
've	PRED	PRED
never	_	_
heard	PRED	PRED
of	_	_
a	_	_
farrier	_	_
doing	_	PRED
this	_	_
)	_	_
and	_	_
telling	_	PRED
me	_	_
to	_	_
call	PRED	PRED
him	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
few	_	_
days	_	_
(	_	_
first	_	_
it	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
week	_	_
,	_	_
then	_	_
it	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
few	_	_
days	_	_
lol	_	_
)	_	_
and	_	_
he	_	_
'd	_	_
come	PRED	PRED
back	_	_
out	_	_
and	_	_
put	PRED	PRED
it	_	_
in	_	_
.	_	_
He	_	_
told	PRED	PRED
me	_	_
to	_	_
remember	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
call	PRED	PRED
like	_	_
3	_	_
times	_	_
before	_	_
he	_	_
left	PRED	PRED
.	_	_
So	_	_
,	_	_
I	_	_
waited	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
week	_	_
to	_	_
call	PRED	PRED
because	_	_
I	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
busy	_	PRED
and	_	_
I	_	_
wanted	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
have	PRED	PRED
him	_	_
come	PRED	PRED
out	_	_
on	_	_
a	_	_
day	_	_
when	_	_
I	_	_
am	PRED	PRED
more	_	_
available	_	PRED
in	_	_
case	_	_
we	_	_
were	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
hang	PRED	PRED
out	_	_
after	_	_
;)	_	_
Anyway	_	_
,	_	_
so	_	_
that	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
2	_	_
days	_	_
ago	_	_
that	_	_
I	_	_
called	PRED	PRED
and	_	_
left	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
message	_	_
,	_	_
but	_	_
he	_	_
still	_	_
has	PRED	PRED
n't	_	_
called	PRED	PRED
back	_	_
yet	_	_
.	_	_
I	_	_
do	PRED	PRED
n't	_	_
know	PRED	PRED
if	_	_
I	_	_
should	_	_
call	PRED	PRED
him	_	_
again	_	_
tomorrow	_	_
or	_	_
not	_	_
?	_	_
I	_	_
know	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
lot	_	_
of	_	_
people	_	_
say	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
wait	PRED	PRED
until	_	_
he	_	_
calls	PRED	PRED
you	_	_
,	_	_
but	_	_
it	_	_
's	PRED	PRED
different	_	PRED
because	_	_
I	_	_
'm	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
client	_	_
and	_	_
technically	_	_
that	_	_
's	PRED	PRED
all	_	_
I	_	_
am	PRED	PRED
at	_	_
this	_	_
point	_	_
.	_	_
On	_	_
the	_	_
other	_	_
hand	_	_
though	_	_
,	_	_
if	_	_
I	_	_
'm	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
client	_	_
he	_	_
should	_	_
really	_	_
of	PRED	PRED
called	PRED	PRED
back	_	_
by	_	_
now	_	_
because	_	_
you	_	_
do	PRED	PRED
n't	_	_
leave	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
customer	_	_
hanging	_	PRED
.	_	_
He	_	_
did	PRED	PRED
n't	_	_
have	PRED	PRED
my	_	_
number	_	_
either	_	_
because	_	_
this	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
first	_	_
time	_	_
I	_	_
've	PRED	PRED
called	PRED	PRED
HIM	_	_
instead	_	_
of	_	_
his	_	_
dad	_	_
.	_	_
It	_	_
's	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
father	_	_
and	_	_
son	_	_
business	_	_
.	_	_
Anyway	_	_
,	_	_
I	_	_
would	_	_
appreciate	PRED	PRED
ANY	_	_
insight	_	_
on	_	_
this	_	_
at	_	_
all	_	_

Thank	PRED	PRED
you	_	_

reading	_	PRED

you	_	_
did	PRED	PRED

:)	_	_
Ok	_	_
,	_	_
well	_	_
as	_	_
far	_	_
as	_	_
him	_	_
being	_	PRED
a	_	_
bad	_	_
farrier	_	_
for	_	_
leaving	_	PRED
a	_	_
nail	_	_
out	_	_
-	_	_
That	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
not	_	_
the	_	_
case	_	PRED
,	_	_
they	_	_
are	PRED	PRED
extremely	_	_
well	_	_
known	PRED	_
farriers	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
area	_	_
.	_	_
I	_	_
would	_	_
be	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
lot	_	_
more	_	_
concerned	_	PRED
if	_	_
the	_	_
shoe	_	_
fell	PRED	PRED
off	_	_
because	_	_
it	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
missing	_	PRED
one	_	_
lousy	_	_
nail	_	_
.	_	_
The	_	_
reason	_	_
he	_	_
said	PRED	PRED
he	_	_
did	PRED	PRED
n't	_	_
put	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
nail	_	_
in	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
because	_	_
he	_	_
|	|	_	_
did	PRED	PRED
n't	_	_
want	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
risk	PRED	PRED
it	_	_
|	|	_	_
with	_	_
my	_	_
horse	_	_
's	_	_
horrible	_	_
feet	_	_
.	_	_
This	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
about	_	_
the	_	_
fourth	_	_
time	_	_
they	_	_
've	PRED	PRED
done	PRED	PRED
my	_	_
horse	_	_
's	_	_
feet	_	_
because	_	_
I	_	_
just	_	_
switched	PRED	PRED
back	_	_
to	_	_
them	_	_
.	_	_
The	_	_
only	_	_
reason	_	_
I	_	_
switched	PRED	PRED
away	_	_
from	_	_
them	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
first	_	_
place	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
because	_	_
my	_	_
good	_	_
friend	_	_
who	_	_
apprenticed	PRED	PRED
with	_	_
them	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
starting	_	PRED
out	_	_
on	_	_
his	_	_
own	_	_
.	_	_
However	_	_
,	_	_
he	_	_
left	PRED	PRED
my	_	_
horse	_	_
without	_	_
a	_	_
shoe	_	_
for	_	_
TWO	_	_
WEEKS	_	_
(	_	_
now	_	_
that	_	_
's	PRED	PRED
what	_	_
I	_	_
call	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
crap	_	_
farrier	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_
Which	_	_
,	_	_
I	_	_
might	_	_
add	PRED	PRED
is	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
same	_	_
foot	_	_
that	_	_
keeps	PRED	PRED
crumbling	_	PRED
with	_	_
the	_	_
nails	_	_
.	_	_
So	_	_
,	_	_
obviously	_	_
I	_	_
switched	PRED	PRED
back	_	_
to	_	_
these	_	_
guys	_	_
.	_	_
Ok	_	_
,	_	_

about	_	_
3	_	_

4	_	_
months	_	_

chalked	PRED	PRED
it	_	_

he	_	_
had	PRED	PRED
no	_	_

problems	_	_

So	_	_
I	_	_
sent	PRED	PRED
him	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
trainers	_	_
the	_	_
first	_	_
of	_	_
September	_	_
to	_	_

I	_	_
got	PRED	PRED
him	_	_

the	_	_
month	_	_

he	_	_

attributed	PRED	PRED
that	_	_

worked	PRED	PRED

(	_	_

He	_	_

the	_	_
left	_	_

seems	PRED	PRED

be	PRED	PRED
dropping	_	PRED

the	_	_
day	_	_

Had	PRED	PRED
him	_	_

a	_	_
dentist	_	_
yesterday	_	_
and	_	_
there	_	_
is	PRED	PRED

He	_	_
can	_	_
eat	PRED	PRED

does	PRED	PRED
n't	_	_
drop	PRED	PRED

can	_	_

He	_	_

is	PRED	PRED
losing	_	PRED
topline	_	_
muscle	_	_
.	_	_
The	_	_
only	_	_
neurological	_	_
sign	_	PRED
that	_	_
he	_	_
shows	PRED	PRED
is	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
he	_	_
barely	_	_
drags	PRED	PRED

The	_	_

wrong	_	PRED
with	_	_

NO	_	_
,	_	_
I	_	_
have	PRED	PRED
not	_	_
done	PRED	PRED

have	PRED	PRED
done	PRED	PRED
an	_	_

my	_	_
vet	_	_
did	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
neurological	_	_
physical	_	_

We	_	_
elected	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
not	_	_
do	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
EPM	_	_
test	_	PRED
because	_	_
there	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
NO	_	_

He	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
still	_	_

no	_	_

other	_	_
than	_	_
the	_	_
weight	_	_
loss	_	PRED
,	_	_
and	_	_
some	_	_
muscle	_	_
atrophy	_	_
.	_	_
He	_	_
eats	PRED	PRED
all	_	_
of	_	_
his	_	_
grain	_	_
but	_	_
it	_	_
just	_	_
takes	PRED	PRED
him	_	_
a	_	_
while	_	_
to	_	_
get	PRED	PRED
it	_	_
chewed	PRED	PRED

So	_	_
I	_	_
might	_	_

see	PRED	PRED

with	_	_
them	_	_

they	_	_
should	_	_
be	PRED	PRED
honest	_	PRED
on	_	_
if	_	_
this	_	_
horse	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
fixable	_	_
to	_	_
any	_	_
degree	_	_
...	_	_
not	_	_
really	_	_
sure	_	PRED
what	_	_
you	_	_
want	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
do	PRED	PRED
with	_	_
him	_	_
...	_	_
Even	_	_
if	_	_
you	_	_
can	_	_
figure	PRED	PRED

what	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
wrong	_	PRED
with	_	_
this	_	_
poor	_	_
poneh	_	_

there	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
always	_	_
the	_	_
chance	_	PRED
for	_	_
remission	_	PRED

then	_	_
relapse	_	_
so	_	_
you	_	_

purchased	PRED	PRED
a	_	_

year	_	_
old	_	_
certified	_	_
pre-owned	_	_
BMW	_	_

this	_	_

The	_	_
night	_	_
I	_	_
drove	PRED	PRED
back	_	_
home	_	_
,	_	_
I	_	_
found	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
the	_	_
rear	_	_
window	_	_
has	PRED	PRED
some	_	_
leakage	_	PRED
.	_	_
(	_	_
You	_	_
can	_	_
hear	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
wind	_	_
while	_	_
driving	_	PRED
on	_	_
highway	_	_
.	_	_
Very	_	_
likely	_	_
it	_	_
needs	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
new	_	_
window	_	_
seal	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_
I	_	_
admit	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
I	_	_
should	_	_
have	PRED	PRED
paid	PRED	PRED
attention	_	PRED
to	_	_
this	_	_
kind	_	_
of	_	_
little	_	_
things	_	_
while	_	_
test	_	_
drive	_	PRED

(	_	_
But	_	_
this	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
a	_	_
certified	_	_
car	_	_
from	_	_
a	_	_
dealer	_	_
.	_	_
)	_	_
So	_	_
I	_	_
brought	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
car	_	_
back	_	_
the	_	_
second	_	_
day	_	_
.	_	_
They	_	_
told	PRED	PRED
me	_	_
that	_	_
this	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
not	_	_
under	_	_
warranty	_	_
and	_	_
want	PRED	PRED
to	_	_
charge	PRED	PRED
me	_	_
$	_	_
175	_	_
just	_	_
to	_	_
diagnose	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
problem	_	_

Who	_	_
knows	PRED	PRED
how	_	_
much	_	_

want	PRED	PRED
me	_	_

fix	PRED	PRED
this	_	_
thing	_	_
.	_	_
I	_	_
walked	PRED	PRED
away	_	_

So	_	_
my	_	_
advice	_	_
is	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
NEVER	_	_
TRUST	PRED	PRED
THIS	_	_

STAY	PRED	PRED
AWAY	_	_

how	_	_
well	_	_

My	_	_

They	_	_

ensure	PRED	PRED

my	_	_
puppy	_	_

We	_	_
have	PRED	PRED

leave	PRED	PRED
him	_	_

3	_	_

I	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
told	PRED	PRED

call	PRED	PRED

where	PRED	PRED

I	_	_
would	_	_

you	_	_
give	PRED	PRED
them	_	_
the	_	_
chance	_	PRED

prove	PRED	PRED

you	_	_

In	_	_
fact	_	_
I	_	_
look	PRED	PRED
forward	_	_
to	_	_
taking	_	PRED
my	_	_
animals	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_

In	_	_
my	_	_

the	_	_

need	PRED	PRED

ever	_	_

learn	PRED	PRED
two	_	_
things	_	_

only	_	_
chat	PRED	PRED

In	_	_
some	_	_

the	_	_

then	_	_
told	PRED	PRED

pull	PRED	PRED
my	_	_

into	_	_
the	_	_
shop	_	_
(	_	_

10	_	_

The	_	_
following	_	_
Friday	_	_

I	_	_
returned	PRED	PRED
with	_	_
my	_	_
car	_	_
to	_	_
go	PRED	PRED
ahead	_	_
and	_	_
replace	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
other	_	_
3	_	_
tires	_	_

which	_	_
were	PRED	PRED
worn	_	_

I	_	_
would	_	_

Once	_	_
again	_	_

quite	_	_
a	_	_
bit	_	_
before	_	_
being	_	PRED
attended	PRED	PRED

I	_	_
got	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
order	_	PRED
completed	PRED	PRED

and	_	_
then	_	_
questioned	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
technician	_	_
since	_	_
it	_	_
came	PRED	PRED
out	_	_
about	_	_
$	_	_
40	_	_
less	_	_
than	_	_
I	_	_
expected	PRED	PRED

He	_	_
said	PRED	PRED
it	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
the	_	_
same	_	_
tire	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
verified	PRED	PRED
this	_	_

after	_	_
checking	_	PRED
both	_	_
the	_	_
actual	_	_
tire	_	_

my	_	_

my	_	_
service	_	_
papers	_	_
from	_	_
earlier	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
week	_	_

However	_	_
,	_	_
when	_	_
he	_	_
printed	PRED	PRED
out	_	_
the	_	_
service	_	_
quote	_	PRED
,	_	_
I	_	_
could	_	_
see	PRED	PRED
that	_	_
it	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
NOT	_	_
the	_	_
correct	_	_
tire	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
was	PRED	PRED
not	_	_
even	_	_
an	_	_
appropriate	_	_
tire	_	_
for	_	_
my	_	_
car	_	_

So	_	_
I	_	_
pointed	PRED	PRED
this	_	_
out	_	_
to	_	_
him	_	_

I	_	_
got	PRED	PRED
